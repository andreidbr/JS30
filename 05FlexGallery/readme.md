# JavaScript30 Challenge 05 - Flexbox gallery
Display images in a dynamic gallery using flexbox

## Lessons learned

This challenge was fairly simple in terms of actual actions, but I spent extra time going through all the different CSS code written by Wes in the base file. I noticed some small yet meaningful effects, like the inset shadow on each panel, which made them stand out a bit more from one another.

I didn't make any meaningful customizations but I will probably spend more time with the CSS code and maybe come back to it when building other things.
